    <p class="testimonial">"We travel a great distance to get to Coterie because bar none, it brings the best of what the world has to offer in fashion to one beautiful, 
    highly organized and efficient venue.  The show is very well signed and the staff are so accommodating from morning's light until day's end. 
    We are always so impressed at how seamlessly orchestrated every aspect of the show is - from registration to meals to shuttle services - every 
    detail is considered."</p>

    <p class="testimonial">“Spring Coterie is always our biggest show of the year since our business is seasonal. We really felt an increase in the energy of the show this time around. 
    We found some great new vendors to introduce for the Spring season and overall we thought the designers really presented great fashion! (total side note – 
    we LOVED the little notebooks and the s’well bottles)”</p>
